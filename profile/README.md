# Sandman

Sandman is a device that is intended to assist people, particularly those with disabilities, in using hospital style beds. Therefore, it is not just software, but a combination of both software and hardware. The software is primarily designed to enable controlling a bed by voice. However, work is also underway on providing analytics of usage through a web interface. The current method of controlling the bed will work with any motorized bed that uses a hand control.

Sandman has a Discord server to support our community. You can join it here: [Sandman Discord](https://discord.gg/XBYtSAXK2B)

Sandman also has a YouTube channel: [Sandman YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@project-sandman).  Check out the channel to see a video demo of a 
bed being controlled by voice.

## Disclaimer

The current methods of using Sandman to control a bed involve either modifying the electronics of the bed's hand control or electrically interfacing with the bed through its controller connector. It is likely that either one of these techniques may void the warranty on the bed. If you choose to do this, you do so at your own risk. We hope that in the future we will be able to develop another technique that avoids these issues.

## More To Come...

Pardon our dust. This project is being converted from its former home under a personal account to an organization. This process will take some time.
